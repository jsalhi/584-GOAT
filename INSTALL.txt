This is a tutorial on how to install Spark-1.5.1 for 
SmartSQL to be built on top of. Once Spark-1.5.1 is
installed go to the README.txt to learn how to setup
SmartSQL and use it! 
1) Go to https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html
    and download Spark release 1.5.1. Select package
    type Source Code and either download type will work.
    Then click download spark-1.5.1.tgz.
2) If you chose Apache Mirro download, click the 
    suggested download that they give you
3) Move the .tgz to wherever you want to store Spark
    and unzip the file
4) Open up a terminal window in the Spark-1.5.1 high
    level directory and run the following command:
        build/mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.4 -Dhadoop.version=2.4.0 -DskipTests clean package
    If there are any errors the following site
    will be better at helping you than I could be
    at predicting that error and helping it.
